I'm currently a graduate assistant at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville. I obtained my Bachelor degree in Electric Engineering from Sichuan University at 2013 and Master degree in Mechanical Engineering from Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville at 2016.

At SIUE, I mainly focus on the periodic motions of time-delay nonlinear dynamical systems under the supervision of Albert C.J. Luo. Nonlinear dynamical system is interesting because it enjoys so many rich phenomena and is still in exploration. The time-delay nonlinear dynamical systems have a wide application in computer network, biology and sociology. I am rather glad to work under Dr.Luo, which provides me a great opportunity to witness and also devote to the development of such a stirring field. 

I am also fascinated with computer programming. I master several computer languages such as C/C++, JAVA, Objective-C, Python, HTML, Linux-shell. I have two year's experience in ios and Android app development in undergraduate. 

I involved with several industry projects to measure the fatigue life, to measure the spring constant of 

My master study successfully retrieves my interests in Mathematics. The Differential Geometry I took in Master open my eyes to the beauty of modern mathematics. Through Differential Geometry, I touched Discrete differential geometry and computational
